# Advent of Code

In this repository, you'll find my solutions.

[![CI](https://github.com/trizz/adventofcode21/actions/workflows/ci.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/trizz/adventofcode21/actions/workflows/ci.yaml)

## ðŸ›  Setup and running
- Run `composer install` to install the dependencies.
- Run `./aoc {day} {year?}` to run the solution for a specific day. If year is not given, use the current year (for example `./aoc 1` to run the code for day 1 2021)
- Run `./aoc21 puzzle {day} {year?}` to get the description of the puzzle for the specific day.
- Run `composer test` to automatically validate the solutions.

## ðŸ§© Add a new puzzle/solution
- Create a directory in `./data/Y??/day?` with the correct name.
  - Create `example.txt` with the example values from the puzzle.
  - Create `data.txt` with your personal input.
  - Create `puzzle.md` with the puzzle. You can use [this plugin](https://github.com/kfarnung/aoc-to-markdown) to easily convert the puzzle to markdown.
- Create a new class in the `src/Y??/` directory and make sure it has the  structure defined below.
- Add this class to the `./aoc` file, and you can run it.
- Add a new test in `./tests` with structure defined below.
- Run `composer test` to run all the tests.
